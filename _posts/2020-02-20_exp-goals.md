See [this](https://github.com/RobBlumberg/xg_model) GitHub repository for all code used in this project. 

## Introduction

The concept of "Expected Goals" (xG for short), is a widely used metric among soccer analysts and fans alike. In fact, the idea of xG has infiltrated the mainstream in recent years, to the point where now, even most casual fans have probably heard of the term. The xG metric essentially describes how many goals we'd expect a team to score based on the chances it creates. Each shot a team takes can be assigned an xG value, ranging from 0 to 1, which represents the probability of that shot resulting in a goal. The xG metric helps provide objectivity in the analysis of a soccer match, since actual score lines can often be misleading given that luck plays such a large role in the game. 

Despite its rising popularity, a stigma has developped around xG, as soccer traditionalists and skeptics have questioned its use. One of the main reasons for this skepticism is likely based on fans' poor understanding of how xG is actually calculated. Many xG models are complete "black-boxes", and fans often only see the final mysterious xG values quoted as single numbers. Therefore, this blog post serves as a comprehensive overview of an xG model I created using [Statsbomb's public data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data). More specifically, the model is created using data from Barcelona's La Liga matches from 2004 to 2016.

## Data exploration

Before creating the model, let's take a look at the data. The data is stored in json files on Statsbomb's public data repository on GitHub. The first step was extracting the information related to all the shots taken in Barcelona's La Liga matches from 2004 to 2016. I wrote a python script to do this, which spits out the information for all shots in a pandas dataframe. The next step was turning this information into useful variables that could be used to train a machine learning model, so-called "feature engineering". Some of the information which came directly from the json files were useful in their initial states, such as the x and y coordinates on the pitch from which the shots were taken, but other information needed to be manipulated to extract useful features. For example, most of the shots came with a "freeze frame", which contain the location on the pitch of each player when the shot was taken. I used this information to extract two features: the number of players between the shot location and the goal, and the number of opponents within a 5 yard radius of the shot location. In all, the final shot features are listed below:

- **play pattern**: pattern of play which led to the shot
- **x start location**: x-location of the shot 
- **y start location**: y-location of the shot 
- **duration**: duration of the shot
- **technique**: technique with which the shot was hit
- **first time**: whether the shot was hit for time or not
- **x gk position**: x-location of the gk when the shot was taken
- **y gk position**: y-location of the gk when the shot was taken
- **type of shot**: whether the shot was from open play or from a set piece (with type of set piece specified)
- **num opponents within 5 yards**: number of opponents which were within 5 yards of the shot location
- **num opponents between shot and goal**: number of opponents which were between the shot location, and the lines connecting the shot location and the two posts
- **outcome**: result of the shot (Goal or not Goal)

### Visualizing relationships

With the features extracted, I performed some data visualization to see how the variables affect the probability of a shot resulting in a goal. This is a useful exercise as it gives us a more intuitive idea of what the models will be doing when calculating expected goal values.
